## Introduction
We were given a dataset, which constains "Fasion_MNIST" data. Those are the images of cloths collected by company named - "Zalando". Our main goal is to build a model which can classifies those images well.
We were given two datasets:
  1. Training dataset which contain 60 000 elemnts
  2. Test dataset which constains 10 000 elements
## Methods
### 3_Task
Library which I used is called : SciKit
I built a model which train itself using training data. After that is evaluates itself uisng testing data.


### 4_Task
Library which I used is called : TensorFlow
